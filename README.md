# Student-Class
 A Student Record Management System that allows users to enter, display, search, update, and delete student data. The program uses arrays to store student information such as roll number, name, class, course, mobile number, and admission year. Users can interact with the system through a menu-based interface.

 Key C++ concepts highlighted in this program: 
#Arrays: The program uses arrays to store data for multiple students. Each array element corresponds to a specific student's information, making it convenient to manage data for multiple records.

#Functions: The code is modularized into functions like enter, show, search, update, and Delete. This modular approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability by separating different functionalities.

#User Input: The program uses cin to obtain user input, allowing users to input student information and choose menu options. The input is then processed to perform various operations on the data.

#Loops: The while(true) loop is used to create a menu-driven user interface that repeatedly prompts the user for their choice until they decide to quit. This loop structure ensures that the program keeps running and responding to user input.

#Switch Statement: A switch statement is utilized to handle different user choices. Depending on the value entered by the user, the program executes the corresponding case, allowing various operations to be performed based on the user's choice.

#Conditional Statements: Conditional statements such as if and else are used to check conditions and determine the appropriate course of action. For example, when checking if there is data to be displayed or determining whether to delete records.

#Data Validation: The program checks the validity of user input, like ensuring the number of students to be entered doesn't exceed the maximum limit. This prevents potential issues or crashes due to invalid input.
